*To run the code: 
`node ArraySlicer.js`

*What the code does: 
Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N equally sized
arrays.
Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the
remainder.

To try the code with a different array, simply edit line 1 in ArraySlicer.js

*Please note, the code works regardless of the types of the elements, for example the array used could be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] or it could be ['elephant', 'dolphin', 'koala'] or even [1, 3, 5, 8, 'pancakes']
